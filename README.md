# README: A* Pathfinding Algorithm with Image Grid

This project implements the A* pathfinding algorithm on a grid derived from an image. The user can select start and end points on the image, and the program will calculate the optimal path using the A* algorithm. The code uses computer vision techniques to create a grid representation of the image, allowing for pathfinding through this grid.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Ensure these packages are installed:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib
```

## Overview
The code performs the following operations:
1. **Image Processing and Grid Creation**: Loads an image, converts it to a grayscale format, and detects edges to create a grid representation. The grid indicates obstacles based on contours in the image.
2. **Point Selection**: Allows the user to select start and end points on the image using mouse clicks.
3. **Pathfinding**: Implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between the selected start and end points. 
4. **Visualization**: Displays the original image with the selected points and the calculated path.

## Usage
1. **Set Image Path**: Change the `image_path` variable to point to the desired image on your system.
   ```python
   image_path = r"C:\path\to\your\image.jpg"
   ```
2. **Run the Code**: Execute the code. A Matplotlib window will open with the image.
3. **Select Start and End Points**: Click on the image to select a start point (green) and an end point (red). The code requires two points.
4. **Calculate the Path**: After closing the Matplotlib window, the code will calculate the path using the A* algorithm and display the image with the path highlighted in green. If no path is found, an appropriate message is displayed.

## Notes
- The grid size can be adjusted via the `grid_size` variable. A smaller grid size offers finer granularity but increases computation time.
- The image should contain distinguishable contours or edges to create the grid properly.
- If the code does not find a path, consider adjusting the start and end points, or check if the grid correctly represents obstacles.

## Troubleshooting
- **No Path Found**: If no path is found, it may be due to obstacles completely blocking the way. Re-evaluate the selected start and end points or adjust the grid size.
- **Invalid Image Path**: Ensure the `image_path` is set to a valid image file.
- **Dependencies Not Installed**: Double-check that you have all the required packages installed in your Python environment.
